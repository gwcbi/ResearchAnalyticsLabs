# Final Project 
## Assignment #2: Outline

Develop a comprehensive, detailed outline of your final research project using the following outline:

1. **Title** (feel free to make modifications from your previous assignment based on feedback and additional research)
2. **Authors:** Your name and affiliation.
3. **Introduction** (including a central hypothesis to be tested/thesis statement)
4. **Methods** (including some description of the data you intend to work with and/or informatics approach(es) you plan to investigate as part of the project)
5. **Results** (some outline and organization of the results you anticipate (or have)
6. **Literature Cited** (including references where appropriate, especially for methods and introductory ideas)

The outline can be more bulleted at this point than paragraphs, but detailed enough to give me an idea of what you are up to and give your group a roadmap for getting the work done.
