# Final Project 
## Assignment #1: Abstract & Title

Develop a research topic centered around health informatics that can capitalize on some of the research analytics approaches presented in class or through your program.  Search the primary research literature to identify papers associated with your research topic to help couch your study in the context of previous work. Develop a title for your research project and a one paragraph ‘abstract’ of how you see the project moving forward.  Submit a project title, your name and affiliation, your one paragraph summary, and at least 5 references for papers from the primary literature you have consulted by the due date.  Use the following format:

1. **Title:** An exciting title that coveys the concept of your project.
2. **Authors:** Your name and affiliation.
3. **Abstract:** A one paragraph description of the research project, the central theme, the dataset(s) to be used, questions to be addressed, and methods.  
4. **References:** Include at least 5 references from the primary literature that you have examined in the context of your background reading for your project that help you place your research in the context of previous work.

The title and abstract are extremely important aspects of a scientific paper as they capture (or not) the attention of your reader and let them know quickly in your research is relevant to their efforts.  So make it as informative as you can.  It is, of course, difficult as you have not done anything yet with respect to the research.  So think about what results you ‘might’ obtain and why such results would be important.  Since this is Research Analytics, we’re also more interested in the methodologies you intend to employ in your research.  So be sure to detail those.

To help you get a feel for titles, abstracts, and references, you should consult the primary scientific literature.  We recommend especially the *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association* [(JAMIA)](https://academic.oup.com/jamia) for medical/health informatics related research and [*Bioinformatics*](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics) for bioinformatics/genomics oriented research.  Note, there are many, many journals that publish scientific literature and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) can help you find relevant literature (but it is up to you to figure out what is good research and what is trash!).
