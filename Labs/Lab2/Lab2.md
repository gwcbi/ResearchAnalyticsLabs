# Problem Set 3: Data Warehouses

## Instructions

1. Identify at least 3 data warehouses that house relevant public health data.  Provide links to each of these data warehouses and a short description of that kinds of information each warehouse contains and why you think it is relevant to public health.
2. Given your three data warehouses, find at least 3 data elements that are common across all three data warehouses as well as 1 data elements that is unique to each.  List those elements (a total of six elements).
3. Now, think of a public health issue that is of interest to you (for example, water quality in Flint, Michigan!).  Describe the sorts of data elements and data types you would collect to feed your Data Warehouse to address questions with your public health issue.
	- Write a few sentence description of your public health issue, what it is, why you think it is important.
	- Create a table of data elements, data types necessary to address your public health issue.
	- Develop a schema showing your public health data inputs and projected outputs to inform public health.
