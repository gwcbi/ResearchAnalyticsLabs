# Problem Set 1: Starting off slow

## Introduction

To get you familiar with the format of this course, we will start slow with an easy assignment. You can complete the statistical analyses in this assignment with any tool you'd likeâ€”there are a variety of appropriate online statistical test calculators available that would be appropriate for this data.

## Data description

This is contingency table is from a real dataset on COVID-19 epidemiology.



| Chronic disease | Survived  |  Did Not Survive  |
|:-------------:| :--------------------:| :--------------:|
| No | 32029 | 1192 |
| Yes | 15 | 78 |

## The question

Are people in this dataset more or less likely to survive COVID-19 if they have a chronic disease? What statistical test did you use? What is the resulting p-value?

## The report

Develop a report (I recommend a Word (or other text editor) document) for your problem set that includes 1) a description of the statistic test used, 2) where you found your calculator, 3) your 'Results' from your statistical test, including descriptions of answers to the questions above.  Save your report as a pdf file and submit your report through the course 2GW site.
