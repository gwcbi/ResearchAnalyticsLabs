# ResearchAnalyticsLabs
Welcome to the course! Here on GitHub you will find all the assignments (Problem Sets, Research Project ramp up, and Final Project) for the course as well as any data and/or links to software/data to be successful in the assignments. There are instructions for each assignment for each week. All assignments are due on Friday of the week of assignment. These dates are also listed below. You will get the most out of the homework and the course if you work on the problem sets/project assignments BEFORE the live session each week and bring your questions to the live session. Good luck with the course and have fun with Research Analytics!

Sincerely,

Professor Crandall
